Given our size, work weeks are a key differentiator for us (larger organizations just can't do this sort of thing in a meaningful way). Being able to come together as a whole organization, 2x each year, exposes each of us to interactions that may spark new ideas and/or lead to new solutions. They are a core part of our annual planning process.</p>","location":"San Francisco, California, USA (Hilton & Parc 55 Union Square)","latitude":37.784878,"longitude":-122.408965,"register":"","twitterLink":"mozilla","tweetUrl":"https://twitter.com/mozilla","email":"support@mozilla.com","orgname":"Mozilla","location_name":"San Francisco, California, USA (Hilton & Parc 55 Union Square)","featuresection":12,"sponsorsection":5,"codeOfConduct":""},"roomsinfo":[{"date":"Monday, 26th Jun","sortKey":"17-06-26","slug":"2017-06-26","starts-at":"12:00","ends-at":"21:00","timeLine":[],"sessions":{},"venue":[{"sessions":[{"start":"18:00","color":"#F0B27A","font_color":"#000000","venue":"Continental Room","end":"21:00","title":"Welcome to San Francisco Reception","type":"Welcome","description":"<p>Welcome to San Francisco Reception</p>","session_id":1002,"audio":"","slides":"","video":"","speakers_list":[],"tracktitle":"Meals w/ Registered Guests","sessiondate":"Monday, 26th Jun","roomname":"Continental Room","sortKey":"Continental Room18:00","top":1250,"bottom":1850,"height":600}],"venue":"Continental Room","slug":"Continental_Room"},{"sessions":[{"start":"12:00","color":"#E74C3C","font_color":"#FFFFFF","venue":"Yosemite Room","end":"20:00","title":"Registration and Information Desk","type":"Registration","description":"<p>Pick up your all hands badge here.
