We will provide design tips for your action logic to allow the conversation to move forward naturally.</p>",

If you are approaching accessibility for the first time, the sheer breadth of the topic can leave you wondering where to start - after all, working to accommodate a diverse range of abilities means there are a correspondingly diverse range of issues to consider. This talk will explain how to effectively review a site for accessibility and how to build accessibility considerations into your team process so each team member knows their role, and has the appropriate training material. The goal is for attendees to walk away with an actionable process which they can immediately use to assess and improve their products' accessibility and overall user experience.</p>",

We all know tracking and understanding performance issues is hard, which is why so many apps are affected by them. Today, we announced Firebase Performance Monitoring, a brand new feature in Firebase that allows you to gain detailed insight into the performance of your app. These insights are highly contextual to actions in your app and are attributed to factors including devices, countries and app versions. What used to be a painstaking effort is now as simple as including an SDK, and making a few API calls!</p>",

Conversation is systematic, but to the surprise of many technologists, this conversational principle actually defies the rules of formal logic. So come find out the non-literal truth of everyday back-and-forths; take advantage of this principled, built-in 'hack' of spoken language; and delight your users with the intuitive ease of everyday conversation.</p>",

But, there are times when it's necessary to present content in a two-dimensional way. With VR, we have the opportunity to reevaluate the nature of screens, and how we view and interact with screen-based content. This talk will cover techniques the Daydream team uses to create legible, usable screen interfaces in VR. We will introduce new workflows, new units, and highlight interaction opportunities and pitfalls.</p>",

You can easily move the neural network model to Android and run the prediction inside mobile phones, to do many AI tricks things like image recognition, motion recognition and etc. But the challenges are the model size and CPU consumption. The models usually takes tens of megabytes, and also consumes CPU power for neural network prediction. In this session, we will discuss tips and tricks to overcome those challenges to bring the latest AI technology to production Android app.</p>",

In our new era of computing where advancements in conversational UIs and artificial intelligence are enabling users in new ways, it's easy to be tempted to take an existing visual-based app or GUI and simply 'convert it to voice'.

Get the scoop on what types of use cases transfer well to voice interactions and why.</p>",

This talk will explain how to effectively review a site for accessibility and how to build accessibility considerations into your team process so each team member knows their role, and has the appropriate training material. The goal is for attendees to walk away with an actionable process which they can immediately use to assess and improve their products' accessibility and overall user experience.</p>",

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers five APIs that provide access to pre-trained machine learning models with a single API call: Google Cloud Vision API, Cloud Speech API, Cloud Natural Language API, Cloud Translation API and Cloud Video API. Using these APIs, you can focus on adding new features to your app rather than building and training your own custom models. In this session we'll share an overview of each API and dive into code with some live demos.</p>",

Conversation is systematic, but to the surprise of many technologists, this conversational principle actually defies the rules of formal logic. So come find out the non-literal truth of everyday back-and-forths; take advantage of this principled, built-in 'hack' of spoken language; and delight your users with the intuitive ease of everyday conversation.</p>",
